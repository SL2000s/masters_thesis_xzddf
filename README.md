# masters_thesis_xzddf

This is a master's thesis project with the purpose to implement and analyze the blind rotation algorithm in https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1564, here called XZDDF.

The repository contains the OpenFHE library with an implementation of the XZDDF algorithm integrated to it. The implementation is neither claimed to be correct, nor safe to use.

Note that, for now, the implementation of the XZDDF algorithm is just supporting Boolean operations. The implementation can be found in the binfhe/ folder, where there are also some examples of how to use it.
