This thesis is a master's thesis in the program Engineering Mathematics, written during the Autumn of 2023.

I would like to acknowledge my supervisor Qian Guo for his invaluable guidance and feedback throughout the whole project. Moreover, the topic he suggested suited me perfectly, containing a lot of beautiful mathematics, challenging problem-solving, and fun algorithm implementation.

At last, I also want to thank my family and friends for their encouragement and support during my whole time at LTH.
