Despite the vast research on the topic in recent years, fully homomorphic encryption schemes remain time-inefficient. The main bottleneck is the so-called bootstrapping, whose purpose is to reduce noise that has accumulated after having performed homomorphic operations on a ciphertext. This thesis is about bootstrapping, and how to do it more efficiently. More specifically, a new algorithm, here called XZDDF, is analyzed. The thesis contains a solution to a problem in the original XZDDF algorithm that was encountered during the project. The new algorithm was then implemented in the open-source library OpenFHE. Theoretically, the algorithm has lower time complexity than previous bootstrapping techniques, but the execution time of the implementation was not faster than other algorithms.

%Despite the vast research about fully homomorphic encryption in recent years, the encryption schemes remain time inefficient. The main bottleneck is the so-called bootstrapping, whose purpose is to reduce noise that has accumulated when performing homomorphic operations on ciphertexts. This thesis is about bootstrapping, and how to do it more efficiently. More specifically, a new algorithm, here called XZDDF, for blind rotation in bootstrapping was analyzed, and then implemented in the open-source library OpenFHE. The thesis also contains a solution to a problem in the original XZDDF algorithm that was encountered during the project. Theoretically, the new algorithm has lower time complexity than previous bootstrapping techniques, but the execution time of the implementation did not perform better than previous algorithms.
